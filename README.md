## Hi, I'm Ali

## What I work on
## What I work on
- Exploratory data analysis and statistical reasoning to understand structure, bias, and variability in real-world datasets
- Feature analysis, hypothesis testing, and model evaluation with a focus on interpretability rather than raw performance
- Data preprocessing and validation pipelines for noisy, heterogeneous data (tabular, time-series, and multimodal)

## Selected Projects
- **Gene Expression Analysis in Liver Cancer**  
  Differential expression analysis comparing healthy vs cancerous liver tissue across 357 samples.  
  Summary statistics and fold-change-based differentiation to identify potential tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes.  
  https://github.com/aliakhlaghiii/Gene_expression.git
- **Diabetes and Stroke Risk Factor Analysis**  
  Exploratory analysis of shared risk factors (hypertension, smoking status, BMI) across independent diabetes and stroke datasets.  
  Distributional and impact-focused comparisons, followed by a feature-based merge to examine potential associations without causal assumptions.  
  https://github.com/aliakhlaghiii/diabetes_stroke.git
- **Exploratory Liver Disease Analysis on Clinical Biomarkers**  
  Statistical analysis of the Indian Liver Patient dataset (583 samples) to compare biochemical markers between diseased and healthy individuals.  
  Non-parametric testing, correlation and regression analyses, and logistic regression highlight statistically significant but weak-to-moderate predictive relationships, complemented by an    interactive Shiny dashboard.

- **Preprocessing of Biomedical Time-Series Signals (ECG-II & PLETH)**  
  Signal processing pipeline for ECG-II and PLETH signals extracted from .vital files, focusing on data quality and robustness.  
  Missing data reconstruction (PCHIP interpolation), outlier correction, median filtering, and static/interactive visualization to prepare signals for downstream biomedical analysis.  
  https://github.com/aliakhlaghiii/Time-series.git
- **Clinically Grounded Image Captioning for Colonoscopy**  
  Multimodal vision–language modeling to convert colonoscopy images into structured clinical captions, bridging raw visual data and downstream reasoning about polyp characteristics.  
  Combines CLIP-based representation learning with BLIP2, FLAN-T5, and MedGemma to emphasize interpretability, robustness, and clinical usability over black-box classification.
